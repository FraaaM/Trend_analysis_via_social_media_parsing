It‚Äôs one of the few movies where I genuinely needed a moment of silence after the credits rolled. The sheer hopelessness and irony of the final scene make it unforgettable‚Äîand so divisive.\n\nWhat gets me is how the movie perfectly builds the tension and despair, only to deliver an ending that‚Äôs so bleak, it almost feels cruel. But that‚Äôs what makes it stand out. Love it or hate it, you have to admit it takes guts to go there.\n\nIt‚Äôs one of those films that sticks with you, whether you want it to or not.",

            "text": "I appreciate the 007 story and want to see good James Bond movies arrive.\n\nBut spying is not the same game it was in the 20th Century, and the stories we are getting are increasingly bizarre and implausible, and it just doesn‚Äôt work to shoehorn 007 into the current year.\n\nSo let‚Äôs bring 007 not only back to the beginning, but let‚Äôs start him as a brand new British spy during World War II, behind the front lines. There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there‚Äôs the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we‚Äôre hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",
